### Key features
- Securely login using HTTPS
- Create pizzas using a drag and drop technique and a pizza shaped canvas
- Receive notifications when friends login or create a new pizza

### Technologies
This is how I will use each of the required technologies:

- HTML. I will have 3 HTML pages, one for login, one for creating a pizza, and one which displays a gallery (Galleria) of all the pizzas
- CSS. Text formatting for titles of pages, organizing the images of the different pizzas and ensuring the page looks clean
- Javascript.  Drag-and-drop mechanics, login, and displaying pizzas when they are created in the galleria
- Service.  Backend service for storing and retrieving pizza images, logins, etc.
- Database/Login.  Stores users and their pizzas in a database, as well as login information securely stored in a database.  Registers and logins users
- WebSocket.  Notifies users when other users login or create a new pizza
- React.  Will be ported to use the React web framework
