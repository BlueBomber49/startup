# Notes

### Github
- It's important to have consistency in commit messages in order to keep them readable and make changes easy to find
- VScode is integrated with Github, which makes it easy to push/pull and sync with Github
- Small and consistent commits are the way to go, that way you have flexibility and an easily trackable changelog
- Commit your changes before leaving the page if working on GitHub, otherwise it won't save them.  (Learned that the hard way)
