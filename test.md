Hey everybody, this is the beginnings of a great startup.  We've got the skills to pay the bills.  I want to see everyone working hard and hardly working, and keeping a straight face and a clean and tidy workspace.  Let's get to it!

Now, this should be quite easy.  Really, this is supposed to be hardly any effort on our part.  Just make it look like we're doing a lot and we'll probably be lauded and praised for a long time coming!
